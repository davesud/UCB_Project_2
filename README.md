Analysis of Results

Overview of Project:
  This analysis compares several different stocks and returns those stocks total daily volume, and their ROI. The Macro is able to look at the data from both sheets and analyze it. The numbers highlighted in red signify a negative number and the numbers highlighted in green signify a positive number. The main purpose of this analysis is to see which stocks did well in the years 2017 and 2018.
  
Results:
  After running the macro it's very clear that stocks in 2018 had a huge dip compared to stocks in 2017. Almost every stock in 2018 besides RUN and ENPH yielded a negative return. All stocks besides TERP yielded a positive return in 2017. The macro took .953125 seconds to execute for the 2018 stocks and it took .8984375 seconds to execute for the 2017 stocks. 

Summary:
  1. Some advantages are that you don't have to recreate the code again and the code is much easier to maintain. Some disadvantages are that sometimes the code doesn't work so you have to spend time trying to debug it and if you make a mistake somewhere it could take a long time to figure out where your error is.
  2. I found it much easier to refactor the original VBA code. I think the macro was able to execute much faster, because of refactored code.
